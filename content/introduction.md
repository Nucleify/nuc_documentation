# Introduction

Welcome to **Nucleify** - a modular, core-driven framework designed for building scalable web applications with Laravel and Nuxt.

## What is Nucleify?

Nucleify is an innovative framework that combines the power of Laravel's backend capabilities with Nuxt's frontend excellence. It provides a modular architecture that allows you to build, extend, and maintain complex applications with ease.

### Key Features

- **Modular Architecture** - Build and organize your application using self-contained modules
- **Atomic Design System** - Create consistent UIs with atoms, molecules, and organisms
- **Full-Stack Integration** - Seamlessly connect Laravel backend with Nuxt frontend
- **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript support throughout the codebase
- **Developer Experience** - Hot module replacement, auto-imports, and more

## Why Nucleify?

Traditional monolithic frameworks often become difficult to maintain as your application grows. Nucleify solves this by:

1. **Separation of Concerns** - Each module handles a specific feature
2. **Reusability** - Modules can be shared across projects
3. **Testability** - Isolated modules are easier to test
4. **Scalability** - Add new features without touching existing code
